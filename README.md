# The Authorial Leverage Framework
As part of my PhD work at UC Santa Cruz in the Expressive Intelligence Studio, I created three different dynamic narrative systems driving three different games. Afterwards, I generalized out the lessons I learned while creating them, and my subsequent career in industry as a technical narrative designer, into what I very self-consciously call The Authorial Leverage Framework.

If you need a quick dip into it, I'd recommend reading the [article version](https://github.com/Logodaedalus/dissertation/blob/e9db6edd68877204f3eff51d12b461a2057639f7/Jacob%20Garbe-The%20Authorial%20Leverage%20Framework.pdf) that's just the framework in 13 pages.

If you want more info with proper citations / positionings within existing thought on this stuff (and aren't put off by academic language) then I'd recommend [the full dissertation](https://github.com/Logodaedalus/dissertation/blob/e9db6edd68877204f3eff51d12b461a2057639f7/Jacob%20Garbe-Increasing%20Authorial%20Leverage%20In%20Generative%20Narrative%20Systems.pdf) but would suggest just reading the Introduction and Conclusion, which comes in at around 35 pages.

If you want a deep dive into each of the three projects, the types of dynamic narrative they tackled, their positioning within some previous really cool work, and their development process/story, then I'm amazed, but yeah, go ahead and read my whole dissertation! It's like 300 pages but has all sorts of gems squirreled away in there.
